# Github Repository and Issue Lister

---
### An interface to add repositories and list issues from each repository.

For this project, it was used some key concepts from ReactJS such as BrowserRouter, Switch and Route for navigation, api calls using Axios, Component State, some lifecycle component methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate) and Styled Components for CSS. The info is stored in browser storage.

App structure:

- App
    - Container (holds main CSS)
      - Main
      - Repository
